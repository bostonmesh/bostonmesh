# MeshCore Resources

Here are the main links we reference most often across **Greater Boston Mesh** for MeshCore.

## Main MeshCore site

The official MeshCore project site is the best place to start for core docs, downloads, and project updates.

- MeshCore: https://meshcore.dev/

## Flasher

Use the flasher to load MeshCore firmware onto supported hardware. This is typically the fastest path from “new board” to “on the air.”

- MeshCore Flasher: https://flasher.meshcore.dev/

## Live Map (Greater Boston Mesh)

Our live map is the quickest way to see active nodes, recent activity, and overall mesh health in near real time. Created by a local resident [Yellowcooln](https://github.com/yellowcooln).

- Live Map: https://live.bostonme.sh/

## Coverage Map (self-hosted)

Our [self-hosted coverage map](https://github.com/nullrouten0/meshcore-coverage-map) focuses on **RF coverage and reach**. Use this when you want a “where does this node actually get out?” view, or when planning new repeater locations.

- Coverage Map: https://coveragemap.bostonme.sh/

## MeshMapper

[MeshMapper](https://wiki.meshmapper.net/) is another visualization and exploration tool that’s great for browsing node placement and coverage patterns, especially when you want a different lens than the live map.
