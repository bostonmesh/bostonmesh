# Introduction

Welcome to the **Greater Boston Mesh (GBM)** — a volunteer-led community working to build a resilient, off-grid communication network across the Greater Boston area. Our goal is simple: create a decentralized system that continues to function even when traditional infrastructure fails.

---

## Why We Exist

Most modern communication depends on centralized services — cell towers, ISPs, cloud providers. When these systems go down, communication goes with them.

Greater Boston Mesh provides an alternative through **community-owned mesh networks** built on low-power radio and open-source software. These networks are:

- **Decentralized** — no single point of failure  
- **Resilient** — built to survive outages  
- **Affordable** — powered by accessible hardware  
- **Open** — anyone can join and contribute

## What We Build

GBM supports and operates **two mesh networks** in the Boston region, each with different capabilities and use cases.

### Meshtastic

Meshtastic is a popular, open-source LoRa mesh platform designed for easy, off-grid messaging, GPS location sharing, and telemetry. It’s simple to set up and great for community participation.

However, during real-world testing around Boston, it quickly became clear that **Meshtastic behaves more like a one-way broadcast network**:

> You can hear other people’s telemetry and occasionally chat messages, but it is very difficult to actually be *part of the conversation*.

Meshtastic excels at mapping, group updates, beaconing, and outdoor communication — but it struggles with reliable, two-way conversational messaging in busy urban areas.

### Meshcore

Meshcore was built to solve the communication reliability issues we encountered with Meshtastic. Meshcore focuses on:

- **Consistent two-way messaging**  
- **Long-range LoRa connectivity**  
- **Secure, encrypted chat**  
- **Reliable routing and message delivery**  
- **Handling dense, high-traffic areas**

Meshcore is our primary network for dependable communication, and **all hardware build guides on this site are for Meshcore nodes only**.

Meshtastic and Meshcore complement each other:  
**Meshtastic for broad participation and telemetry — Meshcore for reliable, conversational communication.**

## Who Can Join

Anyone with interest in resilient communication or community infrastructure is welcome:

- Radio hobbyists  
- Homelab and networking enthusiasts  
- Hikers and outdoor users  
- Preparedness and emergency-minded individuals  
- Curious newcomers  

No prior experience needed.

## Getting Started

1. **Join our Discord** — this is where support and coordination happen.  
2. Visit the **Node Builds** section to choose and build your **Meshcore** node.  
3. Power up your node, configure it for your location, and join the regional network.  
4. (Optional) If you already have a Meshtastic device, feel free to participate on that network as well — but note that our build guides are Meshcore-focused at the current moment.

## Our Vision

We believe in a future where:

- Communities maintain their own resilient communication networks  
- Mesh networking complements traditional infrastructure  
- Knowledge and hardware are shared openly  
- Technology strengthens local connection, not reliance on centralized services  

---

## Notes & Expectations

- The network is community-run and volunteer-powered.  
- Some nodes are fully off-grid; others use mains or uplinked internet.  
- All software and documentation is open-source or community-created.  
- Be respectful, supportive, and collaborative — a strong mesh depends on its people.
