# Introduction

Welcome to **Greater Boston Mesh** — a volunteer-led community building a resilient, off-grid communication network across **Massachusetts and the surrounding region**. While our name originated in the Boston area, our network now spans cities, towns, and rural areas across the entire state.

Our mission is to create a decentralized communication system that continues to operate even when traditional infrastructure fails.

---

## Why We Exist

Modern communication depends on centralized systems — cell towers, internet service providers, and cloud infrastructure. When these systems go down, communication often disappears with them.

Greater Boston Mesh provides an alternative through **community-owned mesh networks** powered by low-power radio and open-source technologies. These systems are:

- **Decentralized** — no single point of failure  
- **Resilient** — functional during outages  
- **Affordable** — using accessible hardware  
- **Open** — anyone can join and contribute

## What We Build

Greater Boston Mesh supports two mesh networks across Massachusetts: **Meshtastic** and **Meshcore**. Both are useful, but each has distinct strengths.

### Meshtastic

Meshtastic is a popular open-source LoRa mesh system designed for off-grid GPS sharing, telemetry, and simple messaging. It's beginner-friendly and widely used.

However, through real-world use across Massachusetts, it became clear that Meshtastic communication is often **one-way**:

> You can hear other people’s telemetry and occasionally chat messages, but it is very difficult to actually be *part of the conversation*.

Meshtastic excels at mapping, outdoor use, beaconing, and casual participation — but it struggles with reliable conversational messaging in busy or noisy RF environments.

### Meshcore

Meshcore was developed to address the communication limitations of Meshtastic. It focuses on:

- **Reliable two-way messaging**  
- **Robust routing and message delivery**  
- **Secure, encrypted communication**  
- **Stable performance in dense or high-traffic areas**  

Because of these strengths, **most of the active statewide network runs Meshcore**.

For that reason:

> **We recommend that new users join the network using Meshcore**, especially if they want dependable communication across Massachusetts.

At the same time:

> **We fully welcome Meshtastic users.**  
> Meshtastic is fun, accessible, and plays an important role in coverage, monitoring, and community participation.

The two networks complement each other:  
**Meshtastic for broad participation and telemetry — Meshcore for reliable, conversation-ready communication.**

## Getting Started

1. **Join our Discord** — this is where support, coordination, and updates happen.  
2. Visit the **Node Builds** section to build your **Meshcore** node (all build guides on this site are Meshcore-based).  
3. Power up your node and help strengthen coverage across Massachusetts.  
4. (Optional) Use Meshtastic as well — it is welcome, even if not our primary network focus.

## Our Vision

We believe in a future where:

- Community-driven networks improve communication resilience  
- Mesh networking complements traditional infrastructure  
- Knowledge and hardware are openly shared  
- Technology empowers local communities across the state  

---

## Notes & Expectations

- The network is entirely volunteer-powered.  
- Some nodes operate fully off-grid; others use mains or uplinks.  
- All tools, software, and documentation are open-source or community-created.  
- Respectful, collaborative participation keeps the mesh strong. 💪
