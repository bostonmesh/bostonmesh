# Hosting a Greater Boston Mesh Node

The **Greater Boston Mesh** is a volunteer-led community building a resilient, off-grid communication network across **Massachusetts and the surrounding region**. While we began in the Boston area, our network now spans cities, towns, schools, homes, and rural communities throughout the state.

Our mission is simple: **create a decentralized communication system that continues operating even when traditional infrastructure fails.** Hosting a node is one of the most impactful ways you can help your community.

## What is this technology all about?

Modern communication relies on infrastructure that can fail: cell towers, internet providers, fiber backbones, cloud platforms, and commercial data centers.

A mesh network is different:  
it uses small, low-power radios that connect **directly to each other**, forming a distributed network that continues to function during:

- power outages  
- natural disasters  
- fiber/cell backhaul failures  
- cyber incidents  
- extreme congestion at large events  
- rural coverage gaps  

Every new node strengthens the network’s reliability for the entire region.

## What you need to know

Greater Boston Mesh supports two complementary technologies:

### **MeshCore**
- Forms the *long-range statewide backbone*
- Best for buildings with height or clear lines of sight
- Perfect for municipalities, emergency ops, public buildings, and commercial sites

### **Meshtastic**
- Ideal for *local*, neighborhood-level coverage
- Great for hobbyists, individuals, and community spaces
- Works alongside MeshCore but serves a different role

You can host **either** or **both**.

If you're unsure which is right for your location, we’ll help you decide.

## Ideal hosting locations

Good sites include:

- **Municipal buildings** (DPW, town hall, water towers, public safety buildings)  
- **Schools, universities, libraries, or campuses**  
- **Churches, synagogues, mosques, and community centers**  
- **Commercial buildings with roof access**  
- **Existing ham / communications towers**  
- **Private homes on hills or with clear views**  

All you need is:

- a small weatherproof device (hand-sized)  
- a safe place to mount it  
- access to standard power  

No special networking, no licensing, and **no internet uplink is required for MeshCore nodes**.

---

## What hosting involves

Hosting is very low effort:

- Installation takes about **10–20 minutes**  
- Power draw is typically **2–5 watts**  
- No maintenance is required beyond keeping the device plugged in  
- We provide guidance or can assist with the setup if needed

## Next steps

If you're interested in hosting a node, please reach out to the person who introduced you to Greater Boston Mesh and share the following information:

- Your **name**
- The **address or approximate location** where you can host a node
- Whether you would like us to **provide hardware**
- Whether you're interested in **MeshCore**, **Meshtastic**, or you're **not sure yet**
- Any details about roof access, building height, or obstructions (optional)

If you found this page independently or prefer to contact us directly, you can also join our public community Discord:= **https://discord.gg/MUVASVEEES**

A volunteer will follow up to help determine the best option for your location.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Does this require internet access?**
No. MeshCore nodes do **not** require internet.  
Meshtastic nodes can use an internet gateway if available, but it is optional.

---

### **Is it safe for buildings, schools, or public facilities?**
Yes. The devices are low-power (typically under 1 watt RF) and meet FCC/CE emissions limits.  
They are passive, non-invasive, and have no access to internal building systems.

---

### **How much power does it use?**
Around **2–5 watts**, similar to an LED night-light.  
At Massachusetts electricity rates, that’s roughly **$2–$4 per year**.

---

### **Will this interfere with existing radios?**
No.  
MeshCore and Meshtastic use licensed or lightly-licensed spectrum that is compatible with existing public safety, ham, and commercial equipment.

---

### **Do I need a radio license?**
No.  
Hosting a node does not require a ham radio license or any special certification.

---

### **Can the community help with installation?**
Yes — volunteers can assist with site assessment, mounting, configuration, and hardware recommendations.
